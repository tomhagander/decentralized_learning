## Installation

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tomhagander/decentralized_deep_learning.git
    cd decentralized_deep_learning
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the experiments, use the following commands. Ensure you have the necessary datasets in place as required by the specific experiment scripts.
